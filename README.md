Base in Spring Boot and using Liquibase and Swagger.

To get it to run locally, download the repo and the following command within command prompt run:

    mvn clean install
    
Once it is running you can find the local swagger page at `http://localhost:8080/index.html` and the test ui at `http://localhost:8080/tester/index.html`.
